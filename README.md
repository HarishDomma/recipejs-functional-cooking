## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- DOM Selection (`querySelector`)
- DOM Manipulation (`innerHTML`)
- Arrow Functions
- Template Literals
- Higher Order Functions (`map`)
- Separation of Concerns (Data vs UI)
- Git Workflow (add, commit, push)

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Recipe data is stored as an array of objects.
2. `createRecipeCard()` converts each object into HTML.
3. `renderRecipes()` uses `map()` to generate all cards.
4. The cards are injected dynamically into the DOM.
5. CSS styles apply automatically based on class names.
